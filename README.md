## The Problem We Solve

AI assistants forget everything between sessions. RAG systems retrieve context but can't learn patterns. Vector databases find similar text but miss relationships.

**You need AI that actually remembers.**

## What AutoMem Does

AutoMem is a **graph-vector memory service** that gives AI assistants durable, relational memory:
- 🧠 **Stores memories** with rich metadata, importance scores, and temporal context
- 🔍 **Recalls with hybrid search** - vector similarity + keyword + tags + time
- 🔗 **Builds knowledge graphs** - 11 relationship types between memories
- 🎯 **Learns patterns** - automatic entity extraction, clustering, and consolidation
- ⚡ **Sub-second recall** - even with millions of memories

### Research-Validated Architecture

AutoMem implements principles from:
- **HippoRAG 2** (2025): Graph-vector hybrid for human-like associative memory
- **A-MEM** (2025): Dynamic memory organization with Zettelkasten principles
- **MELODI** (DeepMind, 2025): 8x memory compression without quality loss
- **ReadAgent** (DeepMind, 2024): 20x context extension through gist memories

## Architecture

```

**FalkorDB** (graph) = canonical record, relationships, consolidation  
**Qdrant** (vectors) = semantic recall, similarity search  
**Dual storage** = Built-in redundancy and disaster recovery

## Why Graph + Vector?

### Traditional RAG (Vector Only)
```
Memory: "Chose PostgreSQL for reliability"
Query: "What database should I use?"
Result: ✅ Finds the memory
         ❌ Doesn't know WHY you chose it
         ❌ Can't connect to related decisions
```

### AutoMem (Graph + Vector)
```
Memory: "Chose PostgreSQL for reliability"
Graph: PREFERS_OVER MongoDB
       RELATES_TO "team expertise" memory
       DERIVED_FROM "boring technology" principle

Query: "What database should I use?"
Result: ✅ Finds the memory
        ✅ Knows your decision factors
        ✅ Shows related preferences
        ✅ Explains your reasoning pattern
```

## Real-World Performance

### Knowledge Graphs That Learn
```python
# After storing: "Migrated to PostgreSQL for operational simplicity"

AutoMem automatically creates:
├── Entity: PostgreSQL (tagged: entity:tool:postgresql)
├── Entity: operational simplicity (tagged: entity:concept:ops-simplicity)
├── Pattern: "prefers boring technology" (reinforced)
├── Temporal: PRECEDED_BY migration planning memory
└── Similarity: SIMILAR_TO "Redis deployment" (both value simplicity)

# Next query: "Should we use Kafka?"
AI recalls:
- Your PostgreSQL decision
- Your "boring tech" pattern
- Related simplicity preferences
→ Suggests: "Based on your operational simplicity pattern, 
   consider RabbitMQ instead"
```

### Hybrid Search That Works
```bash
# Semantic + keyword + tags + time + importance scoring
GET /recall?query=database&tags=decision&time_query=last%20month

Returns memories ranked by:
- Vector similarity (0.64)
- Tag match (0.50)
- Recency (0.90)
- Exact keyword match (1.00)
Final score: 0.82 (weighted combination)
```

## Features

### Core Memory Operations
- **Store** - Rich memories with metadata, importance, timestamps, embeddings
- **Recall** - Hybrid search (vector + keyword + tags + time windows)
- **Update** - Modify memories, auto-regenerate embeddings
- **Delete** - Remove from both graph and vector stores
- **Associate** - Create typed relationships between memories
- **Filter** - Tag-based queries with prefix/exact matching

## Memory Consolidation

AutoMem uses [dream-inspired](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4648295/) consolidation cycles to keep memories fresh and useful:

- **Decay (Hourly)**: Exponential relevance scoring based on age, access, relationships, and importance
- **Creative (Hourly)**: Discovers non-obvious connections between memories (REM-like processing)
- **Cluster (6hrs)**: Groups similar memories and creates meta-patterns
- **Forget (Daily)**: Archives low-relevance memories, deletes very old unused ones

Memories aren't deleted immediately - they're archived first (relevance 0.05-0.2), only removed if they drop below 0.05. Wrong rabbit holes fade naturally (~30-45 days without use). Important connections survive longer.

### Background Intelligence

#### Enrichment Pipeline
Automatically enhances every memory:
- **Entity extraction** - People, projects, tools, concepts (with spaCy)
- **Auto-tagging** - `entity:<type>:<slug>` for structured queries
- **Summaries** - Lightweight snippets for quick scanning
- **Temporal links** - `PRECEDED_BY` to recent memories
- **Semantic neighbors** - `SIMILAR_TO` via cosine similarity
- **Pattern detection** - Reinforces emerging themes

#### Consolidation Engine
Keeps memory fresh over time:
- **Decay** (hourly) - Exponential relevance scoring
- **Creative** (hourly) - Discovers surprising associations
- **Cluster** (6-hourly) - Groups similar embeddings, generates meta-memories
- **Forget** (daily) - Archives/deletes low-relevance memories

### 11 Relationship Types

Build rich knowledge graphs:

| Type | Use Case | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| `RELATES_TO` | General connection | Bug report → Related issue |
| `LEADS_TO` | Causal relationship | Problem → Solution |
| `OCCURRED_BEFORE` | Temporal sequence | Planning → Execution |
| `PREFERS_OVER` | User preferences | PostgreSQL → MongoDB |
| `EXEMPLIFIES` | Pattern examples | Code review → Best practice |
| `CONTRADICTS` | Conflicting info | Old approach → New approach |
| `REINFORCES` | Supporting evidence | Decision → Validation |
| `INVALIDATED_BY` | Outdated info | Legacy docs → Current docs |
| `EVOLVED_INTO` | Knowledge evolution | Initial design → Final design |
| `DERIVED_FROM` | Source tracking | Implementation → Spec |
| `PART_OF` | Hierarchical structure | Feature → Epic |

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended)

Deploy AutoMem + FalkorDB to Railway in 60 seconds:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

👉 **[Deployment Guide](INSTALLATION.md#deployment)** for detailed Railway setup

### Option 2: Docker Compose (Local)

Run everything locally:

```bash
# Clone and start services
git clone https://github.com/verygoodplugins/automem.git
cd automem
make dev

# API: http://localhost:8001
# FalkorDB: localhost:6379
# Qdrant: localhost:6333
```

### Option 3: Development Mode

Run API without Docker:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
PORT=8001 python app.py
```

## API Examples

### Store a Memory
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/memory \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{\n    "content": "Chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for ACID compliance",
    "type": "Decision",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "tags": ["database", "architecture"],
    "importance": 0.9,
    "metadata": {\n      "source": "architecture-meeting",
      "alternatives": ["MongoDB", "MySQL"],
      "deciding_factors": ["ACID", "team_expertise"]
    }
  }'
```

**Available memory types**: `Decision`, `Pattern`, `Preference`, `Style`, `Habit`, `Insight`, `Context` (default)
- **Explicit `type` recommended** when you know the classification
- **Omit `type`** to let enrichment auto-classify from content

### Recall Memories
```bash
# Hybrid search with tags and time
GET /recall?query=database&tags=decision&time_query=last%20month

# Semantic search with vector
GET /recall?embedding=0.12,0.56,...&limit=10

# Tag prefix matching (finds slack:U123:*, slack:channel-ops, etc.)
GET /recall?tags=slack&tag_match=prefix
```

### Create Relationship
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/associate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{\n    "memory1_id": "uuid-postgres-decision",
    "memory2_id": "uuid-mongodb-evaluation",
    "type": "PREFERS_OVER",
    "strength": 0.9
  }'
```

## The Science

AutoMem's architecture is validated by peer-reviewed research:

[HippoRAG 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14802) (Ohio State, June 2025)  
Proves graph-vector hybrid achieves 7% better associative memory than pure vector RAG, approaching human long-term memory performance.

[A-MEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110) (July 2025)  
Validates dynamic memory organization with Zettelkasten-inspired principles - exactly what AutoMem's pattern detection and clustering implement.

[MELODI](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03156v1) (DeepMind, 2024)  
Shows 8x memory compression without quality loss through gist representations - AutoMem's summary generation follows these principles.

[ReadAgent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09727) (DeepMind, 2024)  
Demonstrates 20x context extension via episodic memory - AutoMem's consolidation engine implements similar temporal organization.

We didn't just read the papers - we built the system they describe.
